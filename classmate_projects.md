## Charlie is currently working on creating an R package with a college hockey leagues stats data set. We talked about brainstorming if we could figure out any ways to test his packages without running through the whole package. We did not come up with anything but I suggested exploring on the internet for support.

## Patrick is making an interactive shiny app of Mario Cart statistics. In his app you will be able to select certain character and carts and see which combos are the best for different marios cart courses.

## I was with Patrick again this week. He is still working on his interactive shiny app of Mario Cart statistics. Right now he has made graph and tables, which were working but are not now so he is trying figure that out. He is also trying to make another visualiazation that when you select certain perameters, it will tell you chich parameters would be best for what you want. So say you want a bike that is medium class, the table would then should you what combinations of drivers, courses and levels would give you the greatest chance to won the race.
