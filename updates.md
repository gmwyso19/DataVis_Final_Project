## March 21

Today, I did some research to try to find a data set on PFAS water contamination across the U.S.

I found a data set for my project but it required permission from the organization so I submitted a request form, and then I also installed that blogdown package. I don't really have anythink to push because my work was mostly not in R.

I foumd a data set! So now I have started creating an interactive map of the U.S. for the data that I found. 

## March 28 Begginging of Class

In between class meetings, I worked on sorting through my rather large data set and starting to create a map of California. I realized while working that I want to use Leaflet . And I found some info about the my data set and topic.

## March 28 End of Class

I know it doesn't look like much progress but I have been working all class to try to figure out how to use leaflet to make the graph, as I am having trouble understanding leaflet. Hopefully by next class I will have a leaflet graph made so I can start focusing on additional graphics for my blog, and start to add my work to my blog! 

## April 4 Beginning of Class 

To be honest with you, I was not able to work on the project much this week as I have been struggling with a sinus and ear infection, but I was able to work on it for a couple hours. There I tidyed my data a bit differently so that I was able to make clearer visualizations. I ended up creating a lollipop graph and a facted scatter plot, both of which need some revisions. I also have been watching some tutorials on leaflets.

I worked on trying to make a plotly graph but kept getting and error, and then I also seperated my lollipop graph into two to make it more readable. I was also playing around with my data set to see if I should be using more that just data of California from January 2020.

I worked on my additional visualization. I changed my mappings of concentration, to mappings of average concentrations because it made my visualizations make more sense and look a lot better. I also tried changing the population_served variable to a numeric which eliminated a lot of rows so I need to fix that. But all in all I made a lollipop chart, a scatterplot, and tried to make another lollipop chart of population so I could compare population with average concentration of PFOA.

## April 6 End of Class

Embarassingly I spent most of class today trying to fix my Population variable. I finally got it to return to a character value and used the parse_number() function to make it a numeric again, but now I am having trouble with averaging the population variable. I decided a visualization of the average population per county would be more fair because the certain counties have different recorded populations served within the county. Once this problem is solved though, my additional visualization in my blog will almost be done!
