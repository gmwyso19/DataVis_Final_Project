Today, I did some research to try to find a data set on PFAS water contamination across the U.S.

I found a data set for my project but it required permission from the organization so I submitted a request form, and then I also installed that blogdown package. I don't really have anythink to push because my work was mostly not in R.

I foumd a data set! So now I have started creating an interactive map of the U.S. for the data that I found. 

## March 28 Begginging of Class

In between class meetings, I worked on sorting through my rather large data set and starting to create a map of California. I realized while working that I want to use Leaflet . And I found some info about the my data set and topic.

I know it doesn't look like much progress but I have been working all class to try to figure out how to use leaflet to make the graph, as I am having trouble understanding leaflet. Hopefully by next class I will have a leaflet graph made so I can start focusing on additional graphics for my blog, and start to add my work to my blog! 

## April 4 Beginning of Class 

To be honest with you, I was not able to work on the project much this week as I have been struggling with a sinus and ear infection, but I was able to work on it for a couple hours. There I tidyed my data a bit differently so that I was able to make clearer visualizations. I ended up creating a lollipop graph and a facted scatter plot, both of which need some revisions. I also have been watching some tutorials on leaflets.
