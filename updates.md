I found a data set for my project but it required permission from the organization so I submitted a request form, and then I also installed that blogdown package. I don't really have anythink to push because my work was mostly not in R.

In between class meetings, I worked on sorting through my rather large data set and starting to create a map of California. I realized while working that I want to use Leaflet . And I found some info about the my data set and topic.
